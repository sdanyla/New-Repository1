      <p>I ain't good with bio's but here goes nothing my name is Stephen Danyla, I'm 19 and a Rhode Islander. Though I'd much prefer to be livin in the south, but much to my dismay the best program for video game develpement happens to be in the north. Nevertheless continuing on since this pandemic hit I don't do much anymore. Before this pandemic I would hang with friends and whatnot, I enjoy playing video gameswhenever I get the chance though I'm usually doing homework.<p>      
      </p>To add, I've always enjoyed playing video games, though I've wanted to switch from player to maker and this college is the perfect fit. withit's amazing program to the campus. While remote learning isn't the best, I manage to get the work done. I don't really know what else to put  in my bio other than I'm enjoying college, though it's during this pandemic it's still fun to zoom to classes and learn this new skill and focuson more important things in my major rather than pointless other subjects like humanities.<p>
